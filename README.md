# Summary of the Update

## New features

- Now it can detect nested tags like `#tag/subtag`, also supports find-reference and autocompletion.

> Detecting rule:
>
> - `tags:` at the beginning of a line (_ez note: for performance reason and more accurate parsing, less false positive_)
> - `#` After a whitespace character.
> - the hashtag path is cut off at a whitespace or a punctuation including `!@#$%^&*()=+.,[];:'"?><`.

> The autocompletion is triggered on both `#` and `/`:
>
> - `tags:` at the beginning of a line
> - [`#`]: After a whitespace character.
> - [`/`]: Must followed by a hashtags path, like `#tag/subtag/` will be triggered.

- The counter can count both tags and files. And it can be set to plain mode or deep mode. In deep mode, it will count all files in all depths of the hashtag.

# Hashtags in Markdown notes for VSCode

The extension provides, what is stands for: `#tag` functionality in markdown files. ðŸ˜„
Inspiration comes from [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) and [Nested Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-nested-tags.vscode-nested-tags).

How does this extensions differ from them?

- Markdown Notes provides same hashtag functionality, but also includes [[wiki-links]]. Markdown-hashtags only provides hashtags, so you can combine with different extension, like [Markdown Memo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svsool.markdown-memo).
- Nested tags put hashtags in html comment and YAML front matter. Markdown-hashtags provides similar experience as hashtags in any social networks.
